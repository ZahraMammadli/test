          Full disclosure: I am a geek. I love computers. I love everything
          about them. I spend eight to ten hours a day in front of a computer
          screen as I am coding, debugging, or discussing coding practices and
          methods with other programmers. When I am not programming, I am a
          Product Owner at Snapchat which somtehing i also love to do because it
          gives me clarity on the business side of the project as well. I think
          being on the both sides give me opportunity to speak so to say "both
          languages" . I am deeply impressed when I see smart and beautiful code
          that does something I know is hard to accomplish. These are moments
          when I feel that we have only touched the surface of what we can do
          with computers, and I know that there is a simple solution to the
          current programming problem I am facing; I just need to get my head
          around it. With my spare time, I play around with my operating system,
          trying out new ideas or writing a patch or a bug report to some open
          source application I use. Most of my day has something to do with
          computers, until, of course, my daughter barges into my office and
          demands we play a “real game”, outside!”
